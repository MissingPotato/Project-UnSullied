# Project-UnSullied

This is a personal project that I am working at alone, hopefully after the many itterations it will become something playable and most importantly, fun!

## What is this?

  Just a project of mine that I will use to experiment with differite things, I love giving myself small game goals and try and finish them, this one is the first one I actually upload to git and try and document.

### Release

I don't want to release a crappy version of my game and then have everyone call me out for milking money out of the "Early Access" system from X webiste, so... I'm going to release it when It's going to be playable :)

### Can I help?

  Sure, just download the project and have fun, you can upload any changes at any time and I will check em' out :]
